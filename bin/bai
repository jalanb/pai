#! /usr/bin/env tail -n +2 

Take a script (or the last command)
Parse it as bash or python
    expect functions and a statement
Goto the parsed node at the first statement 
while node
    if the node is at the script
        the scope is the script with all functions removed
            and boring stuff like imports hidden
    elif the node is the last command
        the scope is bash history
    else
        the scope is the current function
    show node
        show the scope that the node is in
        highlight the node
    get key:
        f (default): execute node
        <Left>,h: toggle d/s
        i: insert new node
        <Down>,j: move to current (or first) node in code below node (if available)
        <Up>,k: move to node that called current scope
        <Right>,l: toggle the showing of line numbers
        q: quit
        s: show node with names
        v: show node with names replaced by values
        else: Feck away outta that with yourself now, before I call the guards
